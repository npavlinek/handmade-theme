* Introduction

This is a port of the Emacs theme used by [[https://caseymuratori.com/][Casey Muratori]] on his [[https://handmadehero.org/][Handmade Hero]]
programming series.

It uses very minimal syntax highlighting and is currently only tested for C, C++
and Emacs Lisp.

* Installation

Put =handmade-theme.el= into your =.emacs.d= directory which can be found at
=~/.emacs.d=. On Linux =~= expands to your home directory, for example
=/home/<user>/.emacs.d=. On Windows it expands to =%APPDATA%\.emacs.d=.

In the future this theme might be added to [[https://melpa.org/][MELPA]], in which case these
installation instructions will be much simpler.
